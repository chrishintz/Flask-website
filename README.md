# Flask-website

In this projects we will continue to work on personal website, this time adding the static content to a rails app. This will allow us to add dynamic content in the future. We are going to focus on adding routes, controllers, views, and view helpers to create a logical and DRY application.

Requirements

1) Add each of your html pages as a new route, controller, action, view.
2) Separate the shared content of each page into the application layout.
3) Add your stylesheets to the rails asset pipeline
4) Use variables in your controllers to set custom <title> elements to each page
5) Finalize the style and design of your site.
6) Have a polished site that contains at the least the following:
  i) An image of you.
  ii) A small bio or mission statement
  iii) Social media links
  iv) Prefered contact (probably email)
  v) Your current and past projects and/or work history
